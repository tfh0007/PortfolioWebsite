				<h1>Why Choose Thomas Hansknecht?</h1>
				<p>Let's face it, developing software is difficult. 
					Software products require passionate and hardworking individuals. 
					Software takes many hours of grinding and extensive problem solving. 
					Those without passion or skill will give up easily and develop sub optimal products. </p>
				<p>	<strong>With me it is different.</strong>
					I love to problem solve and work with a team to solve complex and jarring issues. 
					I love finding issues with mine and others work then improving upon them.			
					I have been developing software for 6+ years now and am always passionate about learning and love assisting others.
					I strive for excellence both in the designs I create and the functionality of my products.
					Many projects I have developed with a team and become both a leader and exceptional design influence over the projects in question.</p>

			<h1>My Personal Backstory</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="my__Backstory">
			<div class="my__Backstory__text">
				<p> I first experienced constructing software in my Intro to Python class which I took my 12th grade year at high school.
					I found the projects we worked on engaging and fulfilling and knew that a future in software is what I desired.
					When I went to Spring Hill College, I had the mindset that being in software and business would be my expertise. 
					However, I found development to be a bit more thrilling and engaging over business related activity.
				</p>
			
				<p>I expanded through college and found myself working on more personal software projects that I would develop over the course of months or even years. 
					Eventually I became involved in software related clubs such as the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) and participated in the Ethical Hacking club. 
				Later I began to enter a software competition known as Auburn Hacks. 
				There the "Mario With A Gun" project I discussed on my home page was developed.
				I have since expanded this project and added another level to the game.</p>
			
				<p>Throughout high school I was involved in a lot of extracurricular activities such as soccer, chess, and scouting.
					I invested many years into chess and ranked 18th in the Nation under the U-800 division in the US Chess Federation competition which took place in Atlanta Georgia.
